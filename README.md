# What is this? 
Every time I'm trying to learn a new programming language I write a full snake game from scratch, in order to get used to it and to clarify some of my doubts. This code that you're going to see is not from a person who has deep knowledge of the language, but from somebody who's learning it. It may contain errors or not optimal code snippets, but I prefer to have it here since is part of my learning process. 
Thanks for understanding.
